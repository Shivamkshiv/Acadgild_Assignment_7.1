a) A useful set of APIs is available in the SQLiteOpenHelper class. When you use this class to obtain references to your database, the system performs the potentially long-running operations of creating and updating the database only when needed and not during app startup.
It  create a subclass that overrides the onCreate(), onUpgrade() and onOpen() callback methods. 
b)onUpgrade is basically  used for handling new db changes(could be new columns addition,table addition) for any new version of your app.
c)Use Table Layout with Cursor Adapter.
